\section{Assignment}

The task is to go through the chessboard with legal moves of knight so that each square of the chessboard is visited exactly once. The solution should be proposed to be able to solve the problem for square chessboards of different sizes (at least from size 5x5 to 20x20) and to be able to start the tour through the chessboard on arbitrary initial square.

There exists very good and simple heuristic for solving this problem called \emph{Warnsdorff's rule}. Implement this heuristic to \emph{depth-first search} algorithm and for chessboard 8x8 find one (first) right solution for at least 10 different initial points. Algorithm with the heuristic should be designed and implemented to run also for chessboards of different sizes than just 8x8.
