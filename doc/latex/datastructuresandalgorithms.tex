\section{Data Structures and Algorithms}

We have divide our program into several classes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Main} - Starts the application.
\item \textbf{MainWindow} - Represents the application window.
\item \textbf{ChessboardScene} - Is responsible for visualizing the chessboard.
\item \textbf{Solver} - Is responsible for solving the knight's tour problem and represents the main part of the application.
\item \textbf{Node} - Represents a node in a searching tree.
\end{enumerate}

We have implemented the solution searching algorithm using depth-first search:\cite{UI}

      static: stack, stack containing generated and undeveloped
                     nodes, empty at the beginning
              node, node of searching tree

      stack <- CREATE-STACK(CREATE-NODE(INITIAL-STATE[problem]))

          if stack is empty then return failure
          node <- POP(stack)

              successful then return CHOOSE-SOLUTION(node)

              stack)
      end
