\section{Conclusions}

In this application we have implemented knight's tour solver using depth-first search algorithm.

The advantage of this algorithm is low memory costs because maximum depth of search tree is $d \cdot f$ where $d$ is maximum depth of the tree where $d = n^2 - 1$ where $n$ is a chessboard size and $f$ is the branching factor or asymptotically expressed $O(n)$ which is \emph{linear} space complexity. The disadvantage of this algorithm is worst-case searching time which asymptotically equals $O(f^d)$ which is exponential time complexity.

The application can be easily extended to solve larger chessboard sizes because it is designed to solve chessboards of size $m$x$m$.

We have implemented this application using \emph{Qt Creator} integrated development environment so it can run on multiple target platforms including \emph{Windows}, \emph{Linux} and \emph{Mac}.
