\section{Testing}

We have tested our application on various configurations, so that with various chessboard sizes and knight's initial positions. We tried to turn off the mentioned heuristic and the solution time were incomparably slower. Using the heuristic, the solution searching of some specific configuration took a second but turning off the heuristic, the solution searching of the same configuration could take million years, so the heuristic increase the solution searching speed incomparably. When some solution searching has taken a long time, we cancelled the searching manually.
